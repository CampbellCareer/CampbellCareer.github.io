      <h3 style="text-align:center;color:white;">Addressing Assumptions: What would you tell others that make assumptions about plastic surgery based on what they've seen with celebrities in the media who have very much altered their appearance?</h3>
  <p>That is certainly a component of plastic surgery, and all plastic surgeons do a certain amount of cosmetic surgery that changes or improves a person's appearance.  But a big part of our specialty also involves reconstructive surgery which includes taking care of accident patients, people who have been burned in fires, individuals who had had terrible animal bites, and those that have cancer.  An example of reconstructive surgery would be helping a child who is born without an ear.  For this condition, a  piece of cartilage is taken from one of the patient’s ribs, and an ear is formed and created out of that piece of cartilage.  Also, plastic surgeons have the unique opprotunity to preform surgery on every part of the body from correcting defects in the skull to operating on the sole of the foot.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;color:white;">What are some reasons to choose to become a physician?</h3>
  <p>There are many different responses to this question, including reasons such as so I can help people, I love the topic, so I can make a change in my society, and to impact others.  When I interviewed a physician, he stated “My entire life I've always wanted to help other people.  Being a physician allows you to help people and make their lives better.  It also allows me to utilize my knowledge in science and my technical skills with my hands to help people in a very special way by performing surgery.”</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #111;">What is an average day for a plastic surgeon like?</h3>
  <p>Many surgeons get up very early in the morning for clinic or operating days.  When they get to the hospital or surgery center, they usually either prepare for surgery, work on the patient charts, attend meetings, make rounds, or other productive tasks.  On certain days, surgeons will be in the operating room working/helping a patient.  According to the Journal of the American College of Plastic Surgeons, physicians “teach our residents, medical students, fellows, and our international visitors,”  while operating on the patient.¹  After surgeries or a normal day, patients come in for consultations and in-office procedures.  Usually, surgeons input their patient’s information into a medical record system after this.  Finally, what I also learned is a surgeon’s work is never done with constant responsibility that many carry out once home.

  <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #111;">What are the education requirements for this profession?
</h3>
  <p>It all begins with being a high-school graduate.  Then, a person must go to college and obtain a 4-year Bachelor’s degree. After this, one enrolls in medical school which takes an additional four years.  Residency ranges from six to eight years long and usually involving five years of general surgery training followed by three years of plastic surgery training.  So, in total after high school graduation, it is an additional 16 years of education.

  <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #111;">What are some of the subspecialties of plastic and reconstructive surgery, and can you explain some of them? 
</h3>
<p>Some individuals practice general plastic surgery and deal with a wide variety of different plastic surgery patients.  Subspecialties of plastic surgery include hand surgery, reconstructive microsurgery, burn surgery, craniofacial surgery, pediatric plastic surgery, and aesthetic surgery.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color:white;">How does this career impact your life and how has your experience been? </h3>
  <p>Below is an answer I recieved from a plastic surgeon: <br><br> Being a surgeon has really been a wonderful career.  I've been able to help people that have been victims of devastating injuries, terrible cancers, and those who were born with birth abnormalities.  I have been able to use various procedures such as microsurgery, skin grafts, muscle flaps, and other techniques in hopes to return each of these individual’s lives to some type of normalcy.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color:white;">Explain the status of being board certified.</h3>
  <p>A plastic surgeon becomes board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.  This is a very rigorous process that involves not only a written exam but also an oral examination and takes several years to complete.

  <h3 style="text-align:center;color: #111;">Are there different organizations in plastic surgery?
</h3>
  <p>Yes, for example, there is the Houston Society of Plastic surgeons which is an organization composed of all the surgeons that practice in Houston and the surrounding areas.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color:white;">How do you continue to improve as a plastic surgeon?
</h3>
  <p>Most plastic surgeons are involved in teaching plastic surgery residents, and have to stay up-to-date on all current techniques and principles.  Many also attend many meetings involving continuing medical education and listen to other experts in my field share their knowledge with me.

      <h3 style="text-align:center;color:white;">How about the continuing education that you were required to do each year?</h3>
  <p>Many plastic surgeons participate in continuing education very often.  On a weekly basis, many work with residents and conduct a teaching conference with them.  They also attend local, state, national, and international meetings concerning their specialty to keep up-to-date with all the latest advances.
